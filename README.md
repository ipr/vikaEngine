# vikaEngine

Simple experimentations with vulkan API

To start your own, I suggest using one of templates provided with SDK.
This is mostly following same stuff from scratch to get the background of it.

"Vika" is Finnish and means roughly "fault/error/problem", as in: "my car motor has a problem"
It is also speech-form for "last/final".

Also, it sounds funny.

## Dependencies:

Just Vulkan SDK:
- vulkan.h header file
- vulkan-1 loader library (linker stub .lib and runtime .dll)
